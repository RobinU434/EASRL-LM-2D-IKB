I came up with the idea of tackling the problem the incosistent amount of actions per state. For example taking a simple card game like uno... in uno have to chose a certain card to place on the stack but the amount of cards is varying through the game. 

The initial idea was focused on the state-action-value function Q(s,a). Here I planed to take the available actions as a encoded sequence and tried to translate them into a sequence of propabilities with the same length as the input sequence to achieve some kind of mapping between actions and propabilities to apply them on the environment.

A second approach to this problem is to generate a sequence of actions + their corresponding propability to applay these actions.
