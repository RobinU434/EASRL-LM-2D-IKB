        \caption[policy iteration funnel]{Figure shows the policy iteration funnel. The red arrows are a symbolic policy improvement step which is moving away from a precise value function. The blue arrows are a symbolic policy evaluation step which is moving the current policy further away from a greedy and thus stable policy. Both criterions are moving over time closer together until convergence with the optimal policy $\pi_*$ and the optimal value function $v_*$}
